      <h4>Basic Protection measure against the new coronavirus</h4>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available
        on the WHO website and through your national and local public health
        authority. Most people who become infected experience mild illness and
        recover, but it can be more severe for others. Take care of your health
        and protect others by doing the following:
      </p>
      <div class="section1-wrapper">
        <div>
          <h4>Wash your hands frequently</h4>
          <p>
            Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand
            rub or wash them with soap and water. Why? Washing your hands with
            soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that
            may be on your hands.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>Maintain social distancing</h4>
          <p>
            Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and
            anyone who is coughing or sneezing. Why? When someone coughs or
            sneezes they spray small liquid droplets from their nose or mouth
            which may contain virus. If you are too close, you can breathe in
            the droplets, including the COVID-19 virus if the person coughing
            has the disease.

        <h4>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth</h4>
        <p>
          Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once
          contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or
          mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you
          sick.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>Practice respiratory hygiene</h4>
        <p>
          Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory
          hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow
          or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
          immediately. Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory
          hygiene you protect the people around you from viruses such as cold,
          flu and COVID-19.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h4>
          If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care
          early
        </h4>
        <p>
          Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and
          difficulty breathing, seek medical attention and call in advance.
          Follow the directions of your local health authority. Why? National
          and local authorities will have the most up to date information on the
          situation in your area. Calling in advance will allow your health care
          provider to quickly direct you to the right health facility. This will
          also protect you and help prevent spread of viruses and other
          infections.
